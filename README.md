1. Attach JUnit 5 and Mockito dependencies to your project (via Spring Boot starter or independently)
2. Pick the * biggest_service _class(C) in your application.
3. Create a Test class for * biggest_service _class(C) in src.test.java.com.andersen.$[YOUR_PROJECT_NAME}
4. Use this class to create @Test methods for all methods in * biggest_service _class(C)
5. Every method should be covered by at least 3 test methods - positive, negative and corner case.
6. Use JUnit annotations and method to “init” test data and make assertions and verification checks.
7. Use Mockito to mock DB repository behaviour
