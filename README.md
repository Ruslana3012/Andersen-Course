You need to create 2 storage classes.Your own versions of ArrayList and HashSet.
Your custom ArrayList list should allow a user to Put, Get by index, Delete by index and automatically resize. 
Your custom HashSet list should allow a user to Put, perform “Contains” check , iterate, Delete, automatically resize 
and keep objects uniqueness
